Install the .NET SDK
      Before you start writing code, you need a tool called the .NET SDK. 
      
Run the following command:
      bash
        dotnet new console -n AccessoriesManager
            This will create a new project named AccessoriesManager.

Move to the project folder:
      bash
        cd AccessoriesManager

Create the Accessory class
    We'll create a class that represents an accessory.

    Code: 
      Create a Accessory.cs file in the project folder.

Add and Delete functions
  We will implement two main functions: adding and deleting accessories.

    Code:
      Create a AccessoryManager.cs file in the project folder.

The main program
  Finally, we'll update the Program.cs file to allow the user to add or delete accessories.
